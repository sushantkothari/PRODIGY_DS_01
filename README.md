# Country and Income Group Data Visualization

This project involves the visualization of indicators by country and income group for a specific year. The visualizations are created using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and provide an interactive means to understand the distribution and values of different countries and their respective income groups.

## Key Features

- **Data Filtering**: The project filters data for a specific year to ensure the visualizations are relevant to the desired timeframe.
- **Interactive Bar Charts**: The project includes interactive bar charts that visualize data based on country and income group.
- **Color Mapping**: Utilizes color maps to distinguish between different income groups for clearer visual distinction.

## Importance

- **Policy Making**: Helps policymakers understand economic distributions across different countries and income groups.
- **Educational Use**: Can be used as an educational tool to demonstrate data visualization techniques and economic data analysis.
- **Research**: Provides a basis for researchers to further explore economic indicators and their implications.

## Technical Details

- **Dataset**: The project utilizes a dataset that includes country codes, income groups, and values for different indicators. The specific dataset needs to be loaded into a DataFrame for processing.
- **Data Filtering**: Filters data for the year 2020 to focus on the most recent data available.
- **Visualization**: Uses Matplotlib to create bar charts with a colormap for distinguishing income groups.
